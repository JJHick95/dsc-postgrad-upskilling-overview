# Post Graduation Upskilling Overview

## Introduction

Throughout the program you developed a foundation of skills to transition you to a new career. Now we focus on positioning you in the job market. 

The best evidence of your _current_ skill set is your github profile. Every project repository is a demonstration of your experience and readiness to be employed. During the program itself there is often not much time to fine tune the details of your work. Two sections of the upskilling track walk you through the steps of making your project repositories **shine**.

To _enhance_ your skillset, you will practice SQL and learn introductory R and Tableau. SQL and R are repeatedly listed (with Python) as the skills most _desired by employers_  due to their _high use in the industry_. Tableau is used across consulting firms and government agencies. 

The topics will distributed over four weeks, and should take around 20 hours per week. Each topic will focus on a deliverable you can **add** to your portfolio or **enhance** an existing one.
